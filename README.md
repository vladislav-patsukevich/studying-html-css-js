# Studying html/css and JS

## My goals and wishes

* I'm trying to study programming and I don't know a lot, by I can fix it. 
* For example, I have already known Python a little. It'll appear in another repository in some time.
* I started to learn HTML/CSS, but from that time a had a little time of practice.
* For now I want to focus on Frontend and you'll see here my progress and my code (hope it'll be a good one).
* I believe that I'll reach my goals.
